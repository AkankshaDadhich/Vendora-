# VENDORA
Our project, VENDORA is a platform for vendors like “sabzi waale”, “thele waale” & “fruit waale” that helps them to increase their sales by connecting them directly to the customers, which improves their livelihood & automatically increases the country’s economy. 
VENDORA comprises of two interfaces. 
One, that deals with the customers, providing them ease in adding vegetables and fruits to the cart-list with fast doorstep deliveries without any extra delivery charges. Two, any vendor found in at most 1km of proximity of the customer, gets a notification on his android app having the details of the requirements made by the customer. The customer can then either ask the vendor to supply the required material or can choose from the items on his cart himself. 
The delivery is quick, fresh & concur no delivery or service charges whatsoever.

PAIN POINT / PROBLEM STATEMENT  
There are times when a vendor passed by your house and you wanted to buy some fruits or vegetables but due to some or the other reason you could not. It can be because you live at a higher floor and the voice of the vendor didn’t reach you, or it can be because of the excessive noise on the road. Because of that either of you didn’t connect.
 VENDOR SIDE
With all the investment in commercial markets, street vendors are on the verge of loosing their livelihood. Since no one is focusing on them, we provide them with a chance to earn their livelihood back, by increasing their daily wages & automatically increasing the country’s economy. Since encroachment is a big issue that needs to be dealt with, at the earliest, our product provides the vendors with an alternative solution which gives them the power to be mobile i.e. they can easily rove around and sell their goods.
CUSTOMER SIDE
There are times when we buy fruits & vegetables from online websites and find that they are not up to the mark, not fresh, took more than 4 hours to deliver plus demanded extra delivery charges. Our product helps in eliminating the same.
